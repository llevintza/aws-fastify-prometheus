# GitHub Actions Workflows Summary

This document provides an overview of all GitHub Actions workflows implemented for comprehensive CI/CD automation and quality assurance.

## 📋 Workflow Overview

### 🚀 Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:** Pull requests and pushes to `main` branch
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing and validation pipeline

#### Jobs:
1. **Setup Dependencies** - Caches dependencies for faster builds
2. **TypeScript Type Check** - Validates TypeScript compilation
3. **Lint & Format Check** - ESLint and Prettier validation with circular dependency detection
4. **Security Audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Build Project** - Compiles TypeScript and validates outputs
6. **Test Suite** - Runs tests on Node.js 20 & 22 with coverage validation
7. **Package Validation** - Validates package.json and tests imports
8. **PR Checks** - Generates comprehensive PR status comments
9. **Release** - Semantic release on main branch pushes
10. **CI Success** - Final status aggregation

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Parallel job execution for speed
- ✅ Multi-Node.js version testing (20, 22)
- ✅ Coverage threshold enforcement (40% branches, 24% functions, 45% lines/statements)
- ✅ Artifact storage for build outputs and test results
- ✅ PR status comments with detailed results
- ✅ Automatic semantic releases

**Purpose:** Comprehensive security vulnerability scanning

#### Security Checks:
- 🛡️ npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- 🔍 CodeQL static analysis
- 🔐 Semgrep security rule scanning
- 🕵️ TruffleHog secret detection
- 📊 Security summary reporting
