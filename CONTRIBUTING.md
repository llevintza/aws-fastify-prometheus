## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible using our bug report template.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please use our feature request template and provide as much detail as possible.

### Pull Requests

We follow a **trunk-based development** model. Please read our [Branching Strategy](./docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for detailed information.

**Quick Overview:**
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`: `feature/your-feature-name`
2. Develop your feature using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
3. Test your changes with the automatically generated alpha releases
4. Create a pull request to merge back to `main`
5. After review and approval, your changes will be included in the next stable release

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.0.0 or higher (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
- **Yarn**: Version 4.6.0 (managed via Corepack)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llevintza/aws-fastify-prometheus.git
   cd aws-fastify-prometheus
   ```

2. Set up the correct Node.js version (if using nvm):
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. Enable Corepack to use the correct Yarn version:
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

6. Run linting:
   ```bash
   yarn lint
   ```

5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

## Branching and Release Workflow

We follow a **trunk-based development** approach with automated releases. For complete details, see our [Branching Strategy Guide](./docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md).

### Feature Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop and Test**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new metrics configuration"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Test Alpha Release**:
   - Pushing to your feature branch automatically creates an alpha release (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1`)
   - Test the alpha release to ensure your changes work correctly
   - Install with: `npm install @xoon/fastify-prometheus-metrics@alpha`

4. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Create PR from your feature branch to `main`
   - Include thorough description and testing notes
   - Reference any related issues

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (patch version bump)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (patch version bump)
- `test:` - Test changes (no release)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (no release)

**Breaking Changes:**
```bash
feat!: redesign plugin API

BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration format has changed.
See migration guide for details.
```

### Development Workflow

We use Yarn for all development tasks:

- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint
- `yarn lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `yarn format` - Format code with Prettier
- `yarn format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `yarn build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `yarn build:watch` - Build in watch mode
- `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
- `feat: add prometheus metrics collection`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in metric aggregation`
- `docs: update API documentation`

## Release Process

1. All changes must be made via pull requests
2. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer
3. All checks must pass before merging
4. Releases are created by maintainers using semantic versioning

Feel free to open an issue with the question label, or reach out to the maintainers directly.
