## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.0.0 or higher (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
- **Yarn**: Version 4.6.0 (managed via Corepack)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llevintza/aws-node-prometheus.git
   cd aws-node-prometheus
   ```

2. Set up the correct Node.js version (if using nvm):
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. Enable Corepack to use the correct Yarn version:
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

6. Run linting:
   ```bash
   yarn lint
   ```

5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

### Development Workflow

We use Yarn for all development tasks:

- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint
- `yarn lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `yarn format` - Format code with Prettier
- `yarn format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `yarn build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `yarn build:watch` - Build in watch mode
- `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
- `feat: add prometheus metrics collection`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in metric aggregation`
- `docs: update API documentation`

## Release Process

1. All changes must be made via pull requests
2. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer
3. All checks must pass before merging
4. Releases are created by maintainers using semantic versioning
